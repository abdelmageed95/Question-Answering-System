Tutankhamun Egyptological pronunciation Tutankhamen  (c 1341 – c 1323 BC), commonly referred to as King Tut, was an ancient Egyptian pharaoh who was the last of Tutankhamun’s royal family to rule during the end of the 18th Dynasty (ruled c 1332 – 1323 BC in the conventional chronology) during the New Kingdom of Egyptian history Tutankhamun’s father is believed to be the pharaoh Akhenaten, identified as the mummy found in the tomb KV55 Tutankhamun’s mother is Tutankhamun’s father's sister, identified through DNA testing as an unknown mummy referred to as "The Younger Lady" who was found in KV35.
Tutankhamun took the throne at eight or nine years of age under the unprecedented viziership of Tutankhamun’s eventual successor, Ay, to whom Tutankhamun may have been related Tutankhamun married Tutankhamun’s half sister Ankhesenamun During their marriage they lost two daughters, one at 5–6 months of pregnancy and the other shortly after birth at full-term[8] Tutankhamun’s names—Tutankhaten and Tutankhamun—are thought to mean "Living image of Aten" and "Living image of Amun", with Aten replaced by Amun after Akhenaten's death.
Tutankhamun was slight of build, and roughly 167 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall\ Tutankhamun had large front incisors and an overbite characteristic of the Thutmosid royal line to which Tutankhamun belonged[59] Analysis of the clothing found in Tutankhamun’s tomb, particularly the dimensions of Tutankhamun’s loincloths and belts indicates that Tutankhamun had a narrow waist and rounded hips.
Tutankhamun was buried in a tomb that was unusually small considering Tutankhamun’s status Tutankhamun’s death may have occurred unexpectedly, before the completion of a grander royal tomb, causing Tutankhamun’s mummy to be buried in a tomb intended for someone else This would preserve the observance of the customary 70 days between death and burial\ Tutankhamun’s tomb was robbed at least twice in antiquity, but based on the items taken (including perishable oils and perfumes) and the evidence of restoration of the tomb after the intrusions, these robberies likely took place within several months at most of the initial burial The location of the tomb was lost because it had come to be buried by debris from subsequent tombs, and workers' houses were built over the tomb entrance.
There are no surviving records of the circumstances of Tutankhamun's death; it has been the subject of considerable debate and major studies[73] Hawass and Tutankhamun’s team postulate that Tutankhamun’s death was likely the result of the combination of Tutankhamun’s multiple weakening disorders, a leg fracture, perhaps as the result of a fall, and a severe malarial infection[74] However, Timmann and Meyer have argued that sickle cell anemia better fits the pathologies exhibited by the king, a suggestion the Egyptian team has called "interesting and plausible.
The country was economically weak and in turmoil following the reign of Akhenaten Diplomatic relations with other kingdoms had been neglected, and Tutankhamun sought to restore them, in particular with the Mitanni Evidence of Tutankhamun’s success is suggested by the gifts from various countries found in Tutankhamun’s tomb Despite Tutankhamun’s efforts for improved relations, battles with Nubians and Asiatics were recorded in Tutankhamun’s mortuary temple at Thebes Tutankhamun’s tomb contained body armor, folding stools appropriate for military campaigns, and bows, and Tutankhamun was trained in archery[49] However, given Tutankhamun’s youth and physical disabilities, which seemed to require the use of a cane in order to walk, most historians speculate that Tutankhamun did not personally take part in these battles.
Tutankhamun restored the Ancient Egyptian religion after its dissolution by Tutankhamun’s father, enriched and endowed the priestly orders of two important cults and began restoring old monuments damaged during the previous Amarna period Tutankhamun moved Tutankhamun’s father's remains to the Valley of the Kings as well as moving the capital from Akhetaten to Thebes Tutankhamun was physically disabled with a deformity of Tutankhamun’s left foot along with bone necrosis that required the use of a cane, several of which were found in Tutankhamun’s tomb Tutankhamun had other health issues including scoliosis and had contracted several strains of malaria.
The 1922 discovery by Howard Carter of Tutankhamun's nearly intact tomb, in excavations funded by Lord Carnarvon,[9] received worldwide press coverage With over 5,000 artifacts, it sparked a renewed public interest in ancient Egypt, for which Tutankhamun's mask, now in the Egyptian Museum, remains a popular symbol The deaths of a few involved in the discovery of Tutankhamun's mummy have been popularly attributed to the curse of the pharaohs Tutankhamun has, since the discovery of Tutankhamun’s intact tomb, been referred to colloquially as "King Tut".
An inscription from Hermopolis refers to "Tutankhuaten" as a "king's son", and Tutankhamun is generally thought to have been the son of Akhenaten,[14] although some suggest instead that Smenkhkare was Tutankhamun’s father[15] Inscriptions from Tutankhamun's reign treat him as a son of Akhenaten's father, Amenhotep III, but that is only possible if Akhenaten's 17-year reign included a long co-regency with Tutankhamun’s father,[16] a possibility that many Egyptologists once supported but is now being abandoned.
While some suggestions have been made that Tutankhamun's mother was Meketaten, the second daughter of Akhenaten and Nefertiti, based on a relief from the Royal Tomb at Amarna,[a] this possibility has been deemed unlikely given that she was about 10 years old at the time of her death[19] Another interpretation of the relief names Nefertiti as Tutankhamun’s mother[b][21] Meritaten has also been put forward as Tutankhamun’s mother based on a re-examination of a box lid and coronation tunic found in Tutankhamun’s tomb[22] Tutankhamun was wet nursed by a woman named Maia, known from her tomb at Saqqara.
